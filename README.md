# Program - Buda Api
<sub>it was made 10/30/2022 - Eli-ezer Ramirez<sub>

>> This a simple project where the idea is you can get data about coins BTC in real time. I will create a interface with the Dear PyGui. 

# First steps
<sub>it's recommended.<sub>

```python
   python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
```

>> After install the virtualenv,  you have to create one.

```python
   python3 -m venv <path>/<name> 
```
<sub>path/name replace by the path or name that you want to give virtual env<sub>

>> then you need to activate it.

```bach
   .\<name>\Scripts\activate
```

>> Finally install the file called requirements.txt 

```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<sub>remember the path before requirements.txt if there is one<sub>


>> Thanks very much and if there is a problem I will try to solve
